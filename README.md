# Signal-Processing-in-Practice

This Repository contains assignment code for the SPP course (E9 222) at IISc Bangalore (2022-24)

1- A1- Generate plots for the sampled versions of the Given signals and Compute Discrete-Time Fourier Transform(DTFT) for all

A2- Linear Convolution using Brute Force Method, Toeplitz Matrix Method, DFT and IDFT Method and Circular Convolution using Circulant Matrix Method

A3- 1D, 2D discrete cosine transform

A4- Reconstruct signal using linear Prediction of order N

A5 - For a given image f(m, n), the sharpened imageg(m, n)is obtained as 

g(m, n) =f(m, n) +k[f(m, n)∗h(m, n)],

whereh(m, n) is a high pass filter, such as the Laplacian filter.

A6-  For each of given noisy images (except img167.bmp), find the optimal Gaussian filter ofsize 11×11 with standard deviation from the set{0.1,1,2,4,8}with the best

(a)  mean squared error (MSE)

(b)  structural similarity index (SSIM).

B) Find a bilateral filter to denoise the imagenoisybook.png corrupted by the Gaussian noiseand compare the results with a Gaussian filter that also does equally well visually.
